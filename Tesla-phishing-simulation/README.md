# 🛡️ Tesla-Themed Phishing Simulation Report

This project simulates a real-world phishing campaign against a mock Tesla corporate environment. It's meant for **educational purposes only**, helping cybersecurity students, red-teamers, and blue-teamers understand phishing mechanics from end to end.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 **Objective**: Simulate a social engineering attack via phishing email and landing page.
- 📬 **Phishing Method**: Email disguised as an official Tesla offer.
- 🧲 **Lure**: A fake 40% employee discount on Tesla Model X.
- 🖥️ **Payload**: Weaponized PDF (not included) or credential harvesting.
- 📊 **Platform Used**: GoPhish, HTML templates, and SMTP via Gmail.

## 🧠 What This Teaches

1. How attackers collect target info (LinkedIn, leaks)
2. How phishing infrastructure is built (SMTP, domains)
3. How psychological tricks manipulate human behavior (urgency, authority, scarcity)
4. How phishing emails and fake login pages are crafted to **bypass suspicion**
5. How defenders can spot red flags and train users
